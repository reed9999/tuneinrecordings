# tuneinrecordings
I love TuneIn Radio Pro (not premium) because I can record audio, but it's hard to manage files with only a time stamp. I love languages and world music so manipulating recording on language and related keys would be nice.

I'd like to do the following in priority order (at least top level; some lower-priority sub-use-cases will follow): 

1. Copy all the image files into one nice place 
    - Identify identical images and mark them automatically
2. Let me store things in a logical directory structure, but still fetch them for easy copying to a mobile device.
    - something like en/uk/BBC/Radio-4
3. Would be nice to embed description in name, but 
4. My own related sortable database. 

Here's the super-cool Travis build indicator:
